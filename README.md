# mmctl ![CircleCI branch](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/mattermost/mmctl/master.svg) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/mattermost/mmctl)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/mattermost/mmctl)

A remote CLI tool for
[Mattermost](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server): the
Open Source, self-hosted Slack-alternative.

## Install

To install the project in your `$GOPATH`, simply run:

```
go get -u github.com/mattermost/mmctl
```

### Install shell completions

To install the shell completions for bash, add the following line to
your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile` file:

```sh
source <(mmctl completion bash)
```

For zsh, add the following line to file `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
source <(mmctl completion zsh)
```

## Compile

First we have to install the dependencies of the project. `mmctl`
depends on go version 1.13 or greater.

We can compile the binary with:

```sh
make build
```

## Usage

For the usage of all the commands, use the `--help` flag or check [the tool's documentation](./docs/mmctl.md).

```sh

```

First we have to log into a mattermost instance:

```sh
$ mmctl auth login https://my-instance.example.com --name my-instance --username john.doe --password mysupersecret

  credentials for my-instance: john.doe@https://my-instance.example.com stored

```

We can check the currently stored credentials with:

```sh
$ mmctl auth list

    | Active |        Name | Username |                     InstanceUrl |
    |--------|-------------|----------|---------------------------------|
    |      * | my-instance | john.doe | https://my-instance.example.com |

```

And now we can run commands normally:

```sh
$ mmctl user search john.doe
id: qykfw3t933y38k57ubct77iu9c
username: john.doe
nickname:
position:
first_name: John
last_name: Doe
email: john.doe@example.com
auth_service:
```

## Login methods

### Password

```sh
$ mmctl auth login https://community.mattermost.com --name community --username my-username --password mysupersecret
```

The `login` command can also work interactively, so if you leave any
needed flag empty, `mmctl` will ask you for it interactively:

```sh
$ mmctl auth login https://community.mattermost.com
Connection name: community
Username: my-username
Password:
```

### MFA

If you want to login with MFA, you just need to use the `--mfa-token`
flag:

```sh
$ mmctl auth login https://community.mattermost.com --name community --username my-username --password mysupersecret --mfa-token 123456
```

### Access tokens

Instead of using username and password to log in, you can generate and
use a personal access token to authenticate with a server:

```sh
$ mmctl auth login https://community.mattermost.com --name community --access-token MY_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

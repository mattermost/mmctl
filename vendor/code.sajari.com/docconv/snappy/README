This is a Snappy library for the Go programming language that has been modified to work with Apple files, which fail to set CRC checks and stream identifiers. This version is a total hack, so if you want to use snappy for other projects **DO NOT USE THIS VERSION**. Use the proper version as per below:

To download and install from source:
$ go get code.google.com/p/snappy-go/snappy
